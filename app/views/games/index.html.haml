        #{t(:name)} is one of the oldest game played from around the world.
        The gist of #{t(:name)} is a combination of both bidding and rounds of play with standard playing cards. 
        Known by many names, including "Oh Hell" (as popularized by Bill Clinton). 
        And "Crush" ("crushen" in latin), from the Renaissance period, when great thinkers were known to have been fond players. 
        Leonardo Da Vinci earned his apprenticeship after defeating his master in just this game.
